/*
! Pure Functions & Side Effects
* A Pure Function is a function that, with a given input, always provides the SAME output and does not trigger any side effects.
? Triggering a side effect means it does not change anything outside of the function itself (setting values, etc.)

It's typically a good aim to try to program pure functions when possible.
It eliminates guess work and is easy to understand but it's often impossible to rely only on pure functions.
Rather, we should try out best to code pure first and impure only when it's essential.
