/*
! Working with JavaScript Libraries
? First of all, what are they?
* Some code we write are very specific to our project but many times, we solve many overarching problems as a developer.
* 3rd party libraries are packages of code that have been pre-written and can be used in our projects.
They typically add utility functions and 'make your life easier' code.
