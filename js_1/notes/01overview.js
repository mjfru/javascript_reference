/*
* JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted programming language...while also being a weakly typed language!
  - Dynamic - Not pre-compiled, it's on-the-fly and executed at runtime!
  - Code can also change at run time (a type of variable, for example)

  - Weakly Typed - You don't have to tell JS what data type you're using, they are assumed automatically.
  - Data types are not set in stone but can change.

* JavaScript runs on a host environment
!  - The most common of which is the browser
  - JS was invented to create more dynamic websites by executing in the browser.
  - JS can maniupulate the HTML code, CSS, send background HTTP requests and much more.
  - JS -cannot- access the local filesystem, interact with the operating system, etc.

!  - Others are possible too, such as on a server (thanks Node!)
  - Google's JavaScript engine (V8) was extracted to run JS anywhere (node.js!)
  - Node.js can be executed on any machine and is therefore often used to build web backends (server-side JS)
  - Node.js CAN access the local filesystem, interact wit the operating system, it -cannot- manipulate HTML or CSS.

* Code in JS is parsed, compiled, and executed from top to bottom.
