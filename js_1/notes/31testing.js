/*
! Testing
Yes, we've tested code before but this is more about automating the process and simplifying it.

? Why Test (Like this)?
  - Get an error if you break your code
  - Save time
  - Think about possible issues & bugs
  - Integrate into build workflow
  - Break up complex dependencies
  - Improves your code

? What types of tests can we use?
  * - Fully Isolated (testing one function) -> Unit Tests
      - These are the 'simplest' and thousands will be written.
  * - With dependencies (testing a function that calls another) -> Integration Tests
      - These are harder and quite a few of these will be written.
  * - Full Flow (validating the DOM after a click) -> End-to-End (E2E) Tests
      - These are the most difficult and rarest.

! Testing Setup
* Test Runners
  - Execute your tests, summarize results
  - E.G. Mocha

* Assertion Libraries
  - Define testing logic, conditions
  - E.G. Chai
! Jest does both!

* Headless Browsers
  - Simulates browser interaction
  - E.G. Puppeteer (good for E2E testing)
